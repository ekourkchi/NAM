# NAM \& CF3 online visualizations

This collection provides the python codes that were generated to be used for the Cosmicflows-3 Distance–Velocity Calculators. Please refer to **Kourkchi et al. 2020, AJ, 159, 67** for the further details, or open the following online tools.

Other tools are under developments (in the form of *Jupyter Notebooks') to make online visualizations that enable comparisons between different Cosmicflows density reconstructions. In the folloing plot, the yellow star is the center of the *Coma Cluster*. The density map is color coded and gaalxy flow lines are overplotted.
